  <summary>Why</summary>
  
  Getting a password manager is a smart move for several reasons: (source ChatGPT)

  1. Security: A password manager allows you to generate and store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This reduces the risk of using weak or repeated passwords, which are more vulnerable to hacking.

  1. Convenience: You no longer need to remember dozens of different passwords. A password manager can autofill login details for you, making it easier and faster to access your accounts.

  1. Protection Against Phishing: Password managers can help you avoid phishing sites by only autofilling your credentials on the correct website, reducing the risk of accidentally entering your information on a fake site.

  1. Secure Storage: Many password managers offer secure storage for other sensitive information, like credit card details, secure notes, and personal identification numbers (PINs).

  1. Cross-Device Sync: With a password manager, your passwords are available on all your devices. This means you can securely access your accounts from your phone, tablet, or computer.

  1. Alerts for Breaches: Some password managers notify you if your stored credentials have been part of a data breach, prompting you to change your password before your account is compromised.

 1. Time-Saving: By managing and organizing all your passwords in one place, a password manager can save you time when logging into your accounts or changing passwords.

 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Support: Many password managers support 2FA, adding an extra layer of security to your accounts.

## Credit Freeze

<details>
  <summary>Why</summary>
  Freezing your credit is a good way to protect yourself against identity theft and unauthorized credit activity. 
</details>  
<details>
  <summary>How</summary>
Here’s how you can do it:

1. Contact the Credit Bureaus
You need to request a credit freeze from each of the three major credit bureaus (and others) in the United States.
  
   1. [Experian](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html) or call 888-397-3742
   1. [Equifax](https://my.equifax.com/membercenter/#/freeze) or call 800-525-6285
   1. [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze) or call 800-680-7289

   and

   1. [Lexis Nexus](https://consumer.risk.lexisnexis.com/freeze)
   1. [ChexSystems](https://www.chexsystems.com/security-freeze/information)


1. Provide Necessary Information
When freezing your credit, you’ll need to provide:
Your full name
Social Security number
Date of birth
Address (and possibly previous addresses)
Proof of identity (such as a driver’s license, utility bill, or passport)

1. Receive a PIN or Password
After you freeze your credit, the bureaus will provide you with a PIN or password. Keep this information safe, as you’ll need it to lift the freeze when necessary.

1. Freeze for Free
Since September 21, 2018, freezing and unfreezing your credit is free under federal law.

5. Verify the Freeze
After you’ve completed the process, verify that your credit has been successfully frozen by checking with the bureaus.

6. Freezing Credit for Minors
If you want to freeze the credit of a minor, you will need to provide additional documentation to prove that you are their legal guardian.

7. Lifting the Freeze
When you need to temporarily or permanently lift the freeze (e.g., when applying for a loan or credit card), you can do so using the PIN or password provided. You can lift it online, by phone, or by mail.

Additional Tips:
Consider a Fraud Alert: If you're concerned about identity theft but not ready to freeze your credit, you can place a fraud alert on your credit report. This is less restrictive than a freeze.
Monitor Your Credit: Even with a credit freeze, it’s a good idea to monitor your credit regularly to ensure there are no unauthorized activities.
