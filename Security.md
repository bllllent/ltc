  <summary>Why</summary>
  
  Getting a password manager is a smart move for several reasons: (source ChatGPT)

  1. Security: A password manager allows you to generate and store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This reduces the risk of using weak or repeated passwords, which are more vulnerable to hacking.

  1. Convenience: You no longer need to remember dozens of different passwords. A password manager can autofill login details for you, making it easier and faster to access your accounts.

  1. Protection Against Phishing: Password managers can help you avoid phishing sites by only autofilling your credentials on the correct website, reducing the risk of accidentally entering your information on a fake site.

  1. Secure Storage: Many password managers offer secure storage for other sensitive information, like credit card details, secure notes, and personal identification numbers (PINs).

  1. Cross-Device Sync: With a password manager, your passwords are available on all your devices. This means you can securely access your accounts from your phone, tablet, or computer.

  1. Alerts for Breaches: Some password managers notify you if your stored credentials have been part of a data breach, prompting you to change your password before your account is compromised.

 1. Time-Saving: By managing and organizing all your passwords in one place, a password manager can save you time when logging into your accounts or changing passwords.

 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Support: Many password managers support 2FA, adding an extra layer of security to your accounts.
